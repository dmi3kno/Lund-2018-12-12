# Why this PhD program?

Last 7 years I spent helping companies and individuals making **better decisions**.

In **Business**:

- Main challenges are around frame and alternatives

- Uncertainties are learned from data, simulated or elicited

- Most decisions are single-objective

In **Environmental Science**:

- Multiple, conflicting objectives, complex dynamic systems

- Uncertainties are learned through evidence

# Decision Analysis journey

.pull-left[
Moved to Norway in 2011 to start as **decision support analyst** in Statoil. 

- Methodology shaped by Prof. Reidar Bratvold (University of Stavanger)

- Major capital investment projects: concept selection, appraisal strategy, environmental impact for new infrastructure

- Raised to **principal analyst**, developed and taught *"Introduction to Decision Quality"* course for upper-middle management 

- Modeling in [@Risk](www.palisade.com), Excel, [DPL](www.syncopation.com) and R.
